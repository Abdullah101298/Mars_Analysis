## Background 

We are going to scrape information from different websites to collect information on Mars such as its weather, images, and latest news. We are going to do this using splinter. 

### Step 1 - Web Scraping 

#### NASA Mars News 

Scrape the NASA Mars News Site and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

#### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

Visit the url for JPL Featured Space Image.

Use splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called featured_image_url.

Make sure to find the image url to the full size .jpg image.

Make sure to save a complete url string for this image.

#### Mars Weather


### Step 2 - Flask with MongoDB
